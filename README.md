# covid-19-world-s-analysis
The world's death, confirmed and recovered covid analysis.
Reading from a csv covid dataset i got from Kaggle, with my prior skills of numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit, I was able to analysis and visualize the death covid cases, confirmed and recovered cases for each country and also for the world as a whole.
